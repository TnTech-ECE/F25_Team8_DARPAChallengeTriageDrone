# DARPA Triage Drone 

We are the Fall 2024 Triage Drone capstone team at Tennessee Technological University. We are tackling the [DARPA Triage Challenge](https://www.darpa.mil/research/challenges/darpa-triage-challenge) and continuing the work of the [Fall 24 Team](https://github.com/TnTech-ECE/F24_Team5_DARPA_Triage_Drone). Our task is to implement geolocating and semi-autonomous capabilities to the previous team's drone. This will help save lives by giving first responders a better assessment of a scene so they can get to treating victims faster. This project will be easy to use and extremely versatile.
