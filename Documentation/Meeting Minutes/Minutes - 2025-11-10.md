# Team 8: Darpa Triage Drone

**Team Members:**  
- Kasey Dyess, Job Flores, Wyatt Wheeler, Gideon Befekadu, Zenkline Elle, Brody Smith  

## Week 8 Meetings
- **Discussion:**
    - The team met several times over the past two weeks to transition from the conceptual design phase into detailed design planning  
    - After meeting with Dr. Blair, it was suggested that the project scope be significantly reduced to focus on core functionality  
    - In a follow-up meeting with Dr. Storm, the team decided to utilize the previous design work as a foundation and refine it for integration with the new drone  
    - With this decision, the team established updated subsystem assignments and a clear method for evaluating progress and success  

- **New Subsystem Assignments:**
    - **Drone Operations (Weight distribution, sensor mounting, and flying):** Kasey  
    - **Power & Safety:** Wyatt  
    - **Signal Processing (User interface & signal integrity):** Gideon  
    - **Radar / Heartbeat Sensor / Respiration Rate:** Job  
    - **Drone to PC Link:** Zen  
    - **Microphone / Victim Communication:** Brody  

- **Action Items:**
    - Begin refining subsystem designs based on updated assignments  
    - Focus efforts on integrating existing design elements with the Aurelia X4 drone  
    - Develop measurable criteria for subsystem functionality and performance  

## Summary / Next Steps
- Continue detailed design development with refined subsystems  
- Implement feedback from Dr. Blair and Dr. Storm to maintain a focused project scope  
- Prepare subsystem documentation and begin planning for prototype integration and testing
