# Team 8: Darpa Triage Drone

**Team Members:**  
- Kasey Dyess, Job Flores, Wyatt Wheeler, Gideon Befekadu, Zenkline Elle, Brody Smith  

## Week 5 Meetings
- **Discussion:**
    - Met with Dr. Storm regarding the conceptual design
    - Confirmed there is no update on a new drone; team will continue using the previous drone and repair the damaged motor arm
    - Emphasized that the **block diagram** is essential and must illustrate every subsystem, including all inputs and outputs (power, signals, serial & wireless communications, etc.)
    - The **software and user interaction** should be represented with a **flowchart**, showing autonomous/manual options and decision pathways
    - Specifications and goals should be **highly detailed** to serve as verification benchmarks for prototype success
    - For problems with multiple possible solutions, a **comparative analysis** must be documented, outlining all options, the reasoning, and why the final choice was made
    - Discussed **geo-location methods** such as acoustic, visual, and cell-phone signal tracking; documentation should include chosen methods and justifications
    - Team should **divide subsystems** based on each member’s strengths; once someone finishes their assigned task, they should assist in other ongoing areas (“flexing”)
    - Recommended to start with **complex subsystems**, assigning two members per complex area before moving outward
    - Each subsystem must have at least **one responsible member**
    - Comparative analysis should be detailed and include all considered options and selected methods

- **Action Items:**
    - Begin creating a **detailed hardware block diagram** showing all subsystems, inputs, and outputs
    - Develop a **flowchart** for user and software interactions
    - Research and document potential **geo-location methods** (acoustic, visual, cell-phone)
    - Begin subsystem research and task assignments based on strengths
    - Ensure all comparative analyses are properly documented and justified

## Subsystem Assignments (Research for This Week)
- **Brody & Kasey:** Target Acquisition  
- **Gideon & Zen:** Path Finding  
- **Job & Wyatt:** Existing Systems  

## Summary / Next Steps
- Continue developing the conceptual design and subsystem documentation  
- Begin drafting detailed block diagrams and flowcharts  
- Perform and document comparative analyses for multiple solution paths  
- Ensure every subsystem has clear specifications, responsibilities, and design justification
