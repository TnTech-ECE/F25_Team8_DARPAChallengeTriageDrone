# Team 8: Darpa Triage Drone

**Team Members:**  
- Kasey Dyess, Job Flores, Wyatt Wheeler, Gideon Befekadu, Zenkline Elle, Brody Smith  

## Week 7 Meetings
- **Discussion:**
    - Approved the new drone model: Aurelia X4  
    - All conceptual design updates and future planning will now be based on this drone  
    - Dr. Storm assigned the team to schedule a meeting with Dr. Blair via Teams sometime next week  
    - Plan to take a group picture during the meeting with Dr. Blair  

- **Sub System Task Updates:**
    - **Kasey & Brody:** Working on target acquisition and determining the sensors and methods that best address the project’s detection needs  
    - **Gideon & Zen:** Focusing on pathfinding. With the new drone, GPS and LiDAR sensors are already integrated, so the plan is to collaborate with the target acquisition group to identify a suitable radar for locating people and obstacle detection  
    - **Wyatt & Job:** Concentrating on the previous drone’s subsystems, specifically getting the respiration and heart rate sensors operational again and preparing them for integration with the new drone  

- **Action Items:**
    - Schedule a Teams meeting with Dr. Blair for next week  
    - Take a group photo during the meeting  
    - Continue subsystem development aligned with the Aurelia X4 platform  
    - Ensure integration plans account for the sensors and capabilities already included in the new drone  

## Summary / Next Steps
- Transition all conceptual and subsystem work to align with the Aurelia X4 drone  
- Meet with Dr. Blair to discuss progress and coordination  
- Continue refining subsystem designs and begin planning for integration and testing
