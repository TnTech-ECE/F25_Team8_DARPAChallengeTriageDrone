# Team 8: Darpa Triage Drone
**Team Members:**  
- Kasey Dyess, Job Flores, Wyatt Wheeler, Gideon Befekadu, Zenkline Elle, Brody Smith  

## Week 4 Meetings
- **Teams Meeting with Dr. Storm:**  
  - Discussed project questions with Dr. Storm.  
  - Reviewed previous team’s progress: developed heartbeat, vocal functionality, and respiratory readings (no autonomous functions).  
  - Identified need for a path-finding sensor (likely Lidar) and discussed budget implications.  
  - Learned that the previous group’s drone is broken (motor failure on one wing).  
  - Plan to be prepared for either repairing and using the old drone (Parrot Anafi Ai 4G Robotic Drone) or transitioning to a new one, but avoid budgeting for the $4000 new drone.  
  - Prioritize repair costs of the old drone within the budget.  
  - Main focus: semi-autonomous functionality and geo-location.  
    - Geo-location: determine location of people along a predetermined flight path without manual interference, including degraded conditions.  
    - Potential use of thermal or acoustic sensors.  
  - Need to include payload, weight distribution, operating procedures, and maintenance instructions for the drone and its repairs.  
  - Confirmed no new computing tools need to be ordered.  
  - Emphasized that project proposal, while a draft, must be thorough since it leads into the conceptual design.  
  - Budget: approximately $1,000. Every purchase must be justified and necessary.
 
- **Discord Meeting with the Group:**
  - Discussed the feedback we received from Dr. Storm.
  - Reviewed the previous team's progress and the notes from the meeting with Dr. Storm.
  - Distributed the Project Proposal's workload.
  - Discussed the team's skills and how to compensate for the team's shortcomings.


## Summary / Next Steps
- Plan to repair the Parrot Anafi Ai 4G Robotic Drone and assess costs against $1,000 budget.  
- Begin outlining semi-autonomous and geo-location functions with focus on thermal/acoustic sensor integration.  
- Document payload considerations, weight distribution, operating procedures, and maintenance instructions.  
- Draft a strong project proposal that transitions directly into conceptual design.  
- Ensure all budget items are justified with clear purpose.
